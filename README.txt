# README
- General guidelines:
    - C++11 features have been used to simplify program design.
    - To build the entire assignment at once, use: 
	``` make all ```

## Question : 1
Question 1 demostrates a simple array class which simulates arrays of a particular defined type. In this case a custom class "Address" has been used with data members as "house", "street", "city".
- Usage: ``` make A1 ```
- Then run the a1.o file generated: "./a1.o"


## Question : 2
Question 2 demonstrates use of exceptions in C++. Certain exceptions have been defined and used.
- Usage: ``` make A2 ```
- Then run the a2.o file generated: "./a2.o"


## Question : 3
Question 3 demonstrated a BST template in C++, it can be used to store any values (float, int, char). The values will be asked to fill by the user for demonstration purposes.
- Usage: ``` make A3 ```
- Then run the a3.o file generated: "./a3.o"

to clean the document use:
``` make clean ```
This will remove all .o files froms the directory
